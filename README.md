Ideas:

- real-time experiment tracking
- compare results to the original paper for replication
- whiteboard to code 
- multi-source report generation

- research mainly relying on notes, and wish I didn't need to go back and forth so much between paper and screen I wished this process was more seamless. What if we had an agent that could real your sketches and notes in real time and convert that to mathematical equations or code? to be written in a lab report and then turned into a PDF. All of this from a Snowflake notebook interface. 

- The user can draw their experiments and this gets translated into code that can be extracted for data

- Prompt: Develop a system to generate novel synthetic data at scale given a users goal
